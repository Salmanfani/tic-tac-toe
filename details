Title: Tic-Tac-Toe

Description:
A simple two-player paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell. The first player to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins. If all nine cells are filled without a winning line, the game is a draw.

How to play:
1. Decide which player is X and which is O. X usually goes first.
2. Players alternate turns and place their symbol in any empty cell.
3. Check for a win after each move: three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. If a player wins, the game ends. If the board is full with no winner, it's a draw.

Board notation:
Positions are numbered 1-9 like this:

 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

Example play (moves):
X -> 5
O -> 1
X -> 9
O -> 2
X -> 3
Board now:
 O | O | X
---+---+---
   | X |   
---+---+---
   |   | X
X wins (diagonal 3-5-9).

Basic strategy tips:
- If you can win on your move, do it.
- If the opponent can win on their next move, block them.
- Take the center (5) if available — it's the strongest opening move.
- Take a corner if the center is taken.
- Avoid giving the opponent a fork (two non-blocked winning opportunities).

Simple AI approaches:
1. Rule-based: implement the strategy tips above in order.
2. Minimax algorithm: search the game tree exhaustively (small game) to pick optimal moves.

Pseudocode (minimax, player = maximizing X, opponent = minimizing O):

function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing):
    if game over or depth == 0:
        return evaluation score (+1 for X win, -1 for O win, 0 draw)
    if isMaximizing:
        bestScore = -infinity
        for each empty cell:
            place X in cell
            score = minimax(board, depth-1, false)
            undo move
            bestScore = max(bestScore, score)
        return bestScore
    else:
        bestScore = +infinity
        for each empty cell:
            place O in cell
            score = minimax(board, depth-1, true)
            undo move
            bestScore = min(bestScore, score)
        return bestScore

Notes:
- Tic-tac-toe is a solved game; with perfect play from both sides, the result is a draw.
